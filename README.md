# Proteus Command Line Client

A simple command line client to modify DNS entries in Proteus.

## Installation

Use `pip` to install `proteuscmd`:

```
❯ pip install proteuscmd
```

## Configuration

Configure access credentials in `~/.proteus.json`:
```json
{
	"user": "api-user",
	"password": "super.secret!",
	"url": "https://proteus.example.com"
}
```

You can also specify a map of automatic replacements for domains.
This can be useful if, for example, all your domains also have an alternate domain with a `DNAME` record.
```json
{
	...
	"replace": {
		".ex.com": ".example.com"
	}
}
```

You can configure maps between IPv4 and IPv6 networks:
```json
{
    ...
    "v4_v6_map": [
        {
            "cidr": "192.168.22.0/23",
            "prefix": "2001:123:456:789::/64"
        }
    ]
```

Finally, you can configure default values for admin information.
You can still overwrite them on the command line if needed.
```json
{
    ...
    "admin_email": "someone@example.com",
    "admin_name": "John Doe",
    "admin_phone": "1234"
```
